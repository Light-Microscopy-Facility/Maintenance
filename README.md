#  Macros

##    :microscope: General

* Here we share Macros we use on a regular basis for systems performance checks. Our aim is to increase cooperation between facilities, improve codes and optimise performance checks


##    :microscope: For facility members and collaborators

* Here you can **add material** (create file), **modify**  (edit), **add alternative code**  (branches) and check previous commits (versions).

* This Repository is connected to the facility's *Slack account* (https://light-tub.slack.com), so all changes will be noted on there as well, making it easier to search for a specific file or version.
